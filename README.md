I will accept this challenge to create a project that will help predict the best treatment for chronic diseases.  

My overall objective is to learn what it takes to prevent chronic diseases like heart disease and Diabetes, which in turn can save billions of dollars to hospital spendings.

I will start with Cystic Fibrosis since it is easier to track than the others since I have direct data to it. I myself am diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis so I will be using my previous test results as part of the data.
